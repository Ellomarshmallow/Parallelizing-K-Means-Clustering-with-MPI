## Compiling 
To complie the k-means run:
> mpicc -g -Wall -o mpi-k_means mpi-k_means.c -lm

## Benchmarking
Four expirements were defined for benchmarking. These are running the k-means clustering on:
* Light data set size (8950 rows, 6 columns) with a fixed size of nodes and CPUs while increasing the number of processes used.
* Heavy data set size (17950 rows, 6 columns) with a fixed size of nodes and CPUs while increasing the number of processes used.
* Heavy data set size with increasing nodes along number of processes while keeping CPUs fixed.
* Heavy data set size with increasing CPUs along number of processes while keeping nodes fixed.

The benchmarking for a specific case is run by executing the bash script like so
> ./benchmarking/k-means/light/benchmark-mpi-k_means-light.sh

The PBS scripts will be autogenerated according to the defined experiment and all jobs will be submitted, with each individual test case being submitted ten times to later on average out different runs to get a more representative time.

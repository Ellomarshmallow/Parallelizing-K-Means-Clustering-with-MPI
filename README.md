# HPC4DS

## Compiling 
To complie the k-means run:
> mpicc -g -Wall -o mpi-k_means mpi-k_means.c -lm

## Benchmarking
Three expirements were defined for benchmarking. These are running the k-means clustering on:
* a light dataset with 895 rows increasing the number of processes while keeping processors and cpus stead
* a heavy dataset with 8950 rows increasing the number of processes while keeping processors and cpus stead
* a light dataset with 895 rows increasing the number of processors along the number of processes, keeping cpus to 1

The benchmarking for a specific case is run by executing the bash script like so
> ./benchmarking/light/benchmark-mpi-k_means-light.sh

The PBS scripts will be autogenerated according to the defined experiment and all jobs will be submitted, with each individual test case being submitted three times to later on average out different runs to get a more representative time.
